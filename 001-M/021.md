# `bond_validator` uses `self.signer` as validator's address, which will make `set_validator_state` uncallable if the validator uses account abstraction

## Summary
`bond_validator` uses `self.signer` to identify the validator, while `set_validator_state` uses `self.caller` to identify the validator. This makes `credits.aleo` incompatible with account abstraction and can cause loss of functionality when the validator is using an account abstraction method.

`self.signer` is the address of the transaction signer, while `self.caller` is the address of the intermediate contract (if present) that makes the call.
## Vulnerability Detail
The [`bond_validator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/55b2e4a02f27602a54c11f964f6f610fee6f4ab8/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L159) function uses `self.signer` as the validator's address in order to self-bond.
```java
function bond_validator:
    // Input the withdrawal address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the amount of microcredits to bond.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Input the commission percentage.
    input r2 as u8.public;

    // Ensure the withdrawal address is not the validator address.
    assert.neq self.signer r0;

    // Determine if the amount is at least 1 credit.
    gte r1 1_000_000u64 into r3;
    // Enforce the amount is at least 1 credit.
    assert.eq r3 true;

    // Ensure the commission percentage does not exceed 100%.
    gt r2 100u8 into r4;
    assert.neq r4 true;

    // Bond the specified amount of microcredits to the specified validator.
@=> async bond_validator self.signer r0 r1 r2 into r5;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r5 as credits.aleo/bond_validator.future;
```
Once the validator joins the committee, they can use the `set_validator_state` function to close themselves to new delegators. This function serves two purposes :
```java
1. Allow a validator to leave the committee, by closing themselves to stakers and then unbonding all of their stakers.
2. Allow a validator to maintain their % of stake, by closing themselves to allowing more stakers to bond to them.
```
However, this function uses `self.caller` as the validator's address : 
```java
function set_validator_state:
    // Input the 'is_open' state.
    input r0 as boolean.public;
    // Set the validator to be either open or closed to new stakers.
@=> async set_validator_state self.caller r0 into r1;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r1 as credits.aleo/set_validator_state.future;

finalize set_validator_state:
    // Input the validator's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the 'is_open' state.
    input r1 as boolean.public;

    // Get the committee state for the specified validator.
    // If the validator does not exist, this finalize scope will fail.
@=> get committee[r0] into r2;

    // Construct the updated committee state.
    cast r1 r2.commission into r3 as committee_state;
    // Update the committee state for the specified validator.
    set r3 into committee[r0];
```
This means that if the validator uses an intermediate contract (like a smart wallet) to bond as a validator, `set_validator_state` would revert as it uses `self.caller` to identify the validator, which is the intermediate contract's address and not the validator's.
## Impact
By not being able to close delegations by new stakers, validators will lose stake %, which will lead to lesser rewards for the validator. Also, it would make the process of unbending stakers to leave the committee cumbersome, as new delegators constantly bond to the validator

## Recommendation
Use `self.caller` in `bond_validator`, Alternatively use `self.signer` in `set_validator_state`
