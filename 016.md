# The unbond function should distinguish between calls made by the Validator and the Delegator when removing a validator.

## Summary
The unbond function should distinguish between calls made by the Validator and the Delegator when removing a validator.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/main/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L600

The unbond function should distinguish whether it is called by the Validator or the Delegator when removing_validator. If it is called by the Validator, the current processing flow is fine. The funds of the Validator's Delegator need to be put into the unbond to ensure a height of 360 before continuing the bond_validator. However, if this function is called by an ordinary staker, the remove_validator can be removed, but once new Delegator funds come in, the Validator can bond_validator in time

## Impact
There should be a difference between remove_validator caused by validator and staker calling unbond

## Code Snippet
       /* Unbonding */

        // Retrieve or initialize the unbonding state.
        get.or_use unbonding[r5.validator] r4 into r45;
        // Increment the unbond amount by the full bonded amount.
        // Note: If the addition overflows, reject the transition.
        add r30.microcredits r45.microcredits into r46;
        // Construct the updated unbond state.
        cast r46 r3 into r47 as unbond_state;
        // Store the new unbonding state.
        set r47 into unbonding[r5.validator];


## Tool used

Manual Review
yes

## Recommendation
When the caller is not a Validator, remove_validator should not be executed https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/main/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L600-605
