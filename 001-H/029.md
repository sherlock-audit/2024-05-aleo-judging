# The `transfer_public_as_signer` function can be used by a malicious program/contract to steal users credits

## Summary
Due to the weak sender requirement in the `transfer_public_as_signer` function, a malicious program can be created to steal users' credits without their awareness.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transfer_public_as_signer` function uses `self.signer` as the sender of credits, so it means that a intermediate program can call the function while the sender of the credits will be the user calling the intermediate program. This can be exploited by a malicious actor that makes a program seems legit but when a user interacts with it, it calls `transfer_public_as_signer` with setting the receiver to the malicious actor and the amount to the user's public credits, resulting in the user's credits being transferred(stolen) without their knowledge. This issue arises because users do not need to explicitly authorize these transfers, making the function convenient but problematic.

## Impact
Loss of funds for users who interact with a malicious program.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Delete the function since there is already a `transfer_public` function that uses the caller as the sender or introduce a mechanism similar to ERC-20's `approve` and `transferFrom` to ensure that users explicitly authorize transfers.
