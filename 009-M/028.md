# Validators that are already in the committee can self bond while they are unbonding

## Summary
The `bond_validator` function only checks if a validator is unbonding if they are not already in the committee(new validator). 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `bond_validator` function, the check to ensure a validator is not unbonding is only performed in the code block if the validator is not already in the committee. This allows validators in the committee to bond additional credits even if they are in the process of unbonding. Normal delegators/stakers cannot bond to a validator that is unbonding either, creating a logical inconsistency.

## Impact
Logical inconsistency and potential abuse of the bonding and unbonding mechanism.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move the unbonding state check outside of the conditional block to ensure it is always performed, preventing validators from bonding additional credits while unbonding and maintaining consistency with the rules for new committee validators and delegators/stakers.
