# The `fee_public` can be used to delete all the Aleo credits from user

## Summary

The `fee_public` method can be used to delete all the Aleo credits from user

## Vulnerability Detail
`self.signer` is equivalent to `tx.origin`, where the `self.signer` is the originator of the transaction.

This creates a huge risk when used in `fee_public` because a malicious Aleo program in the call flow can make an external call to `fee_public` in `credits.aleo` and set any fee amount to delete which can cause all the Aleo credits of the transaction originator to be deleted.

```aleo
// The `fee_public` function charges the specified amount from the sender's account.
function fee_public:
    // Input the amount.
    input r0 as u64.public;
    // Input the priority fee amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Input the deployment or execution ID.
    input r2 as field.public;
    // Ensure the amount is nonzero.
    assert.neq r0 0u64;
    // Ensure the deployment or execution ID is nonzero.
    assert.neq r2 0field;
    // Add the fee and priority fee amounts.
    add r0 r1 into r3;
    // Decrement the balance of the sender publicly.
    async fee_public self.signer r3 into r4;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r4 as credits.aleo/fee_public.future;

finalize fee_public:
    // Input the sender's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the total fee amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Retrieve the balance of the sender.
    // If `account[r0]` does not exist, `fee_public` is reverted.
    get account[r0] into r2;
    // Decrements `account[r0]` by `r1`.
    // If `r2 - r1` underflows, `fee_public` is reverted.
    sub r2 r1 into r3;
    // Updates the balance of the sender.
    set r3 into account[r0];
```
