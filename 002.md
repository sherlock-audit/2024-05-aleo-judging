# Potential Exploit with unbond_public Allowing Commission Change without Notice

## Summary
The `unbond_public` and `bond_validator` functions allows a validator to change their commission by unbonding and then re-bonding, without notifying delegators, only need wait 360 blocks.

## Vulnerability Detail
A validator can change their commission percentage by using `unbond_public` followed by `bond_validator`. Delegators are not automatically notified of this change unless they actively check, potentially leading to trust and operational issues.

## Impact
Delegators may be unaware of commission changes, leading to possible financial losses and trust issues within the system. A validator could suddenly increase their commission, causing unexpected losses for the delegators.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an interval restriction on validator unbonding to prevent frequent changes to commission percentages. This can ensure that changes are made transparently and give delegators time to react.
