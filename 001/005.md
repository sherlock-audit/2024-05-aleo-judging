# Using `self.signer` in `bond_validator` can allow external malicious programs to drain the signers microcredits

## Summary
 
Using `self.signer` in `bond_validator` can allow external malicious programs to drain the signers microcredits

## Vulnerability Detail
`self.signer` is equivalent to `tx.origin`, where the `self.signer` is the originator of the transaction.

This creates a huge risk when used in `bond_validator` because a malicious Aleo program in the call flow can make an external call to `bond_validator` in `credits.aleo` which can cause an eligible validator with 10M total delegated credits that originated the transaction to bond without their consent.

```aleo
// The `transfer_public_as_signer` function sends the specified amount
// from the signer's `account` to the receiver's `account`.
function bond_validator:
    // Input the withdrawal address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the amount of microcredits to bond.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Input the commission percentage.
    input r2 as u8.public;

    // Ensure the withdrawal address is not the validator address.
    assert.neq self.signer r0;

    // Determine if the amount is at least 1 credit.
    gte r1 1_000_000u64 into r3;
    // Enforce the amount is at least 1 credit.
    assert.eq r3 true;

    // Ensure the commission percentage does not exceed 100%.
    gt r2 100u8 into r4;
    assert.neq r4 true;

    // Bond the specified amount of microcredits to the specified validator.
    async bond_validator self.signer r0 r1 r2 into r5;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r5 as credits.aleo/bond_validator.future;
```
## Impact

An attack path to **fully drain all the credits** is as follows:

1. Victim first calls a malicious Aleo program in the call flow, which first delegates 10M credits to the user.
2. The Aleo program calls `bond_validator` with an attacker-controlled address as the withdrawal address, all the microcredits of the victim and an arbitrary commission percentage
3. Then the attacker-controlled withdrawal address will call `unbond_public` on the victim
4. Once the unbonding process is done (after 360 blocks passed), the attacker-controlled withdrawal address can then claim back the victim's microcredits, thus having fully drained them.

## Recommendation

Use `self.caller` which is equivalent to `msg.sender`
