# The `fee_private` function has public inputs that should be restricted to private

## Summary
The `fee_private` function has public inputs, these inputs should be private to ensure the confidentiality of transaction details and maintain privacy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `fee_private` function, the parameters `r1`, `r2`, and `r3` are public. This exposes transaction details, such as the fee amount and execution ID, which should remain confidential. 

## Impact
Privacy leaks for users that interact with the function
