# `bond_public` delegator balance check needs reordering

## Summary

`bond_public`'s check that the calling account has adequate funds is needlessly far into the function's execution, opening up the Aleo network to more resource consumption than is needed to determine the validity of the call.

## Vulnerability Detail

`bond_public` has a check to verify that the calling account does indeed have adequate funds to call the function. This check should be brought to the top of the function to make this function robust against DOS attacks. It is crucial to keep all verification checks as close to the entrypoint of a function as possible to prevent provers and the Aleo network from wasting CPU cycles and state reads/writes on invalid calls.

## Impact

Critical pre-deployed code should be entirely resilient to DOS vectors. Having the Aleo network compute more invalid `finalize` transition code than is necessary opens it up to DOS. It is possible to get a transaction with an underfunded call like this past the `speculate` phase of a prover and into a block to be computed by the entire network due to the relatively minimal set of proof conditions required for `bond_public`. 

This entire section of code should not be run until after the account check. It contains 4 state writes, 2 state reads, and multiple assertions, conditionals, and arithmetic operations that will ultimately be reverted and thrown out if the calling account is not sufficiently funded to make the call. The Aleo network should seize the transaction fee and reject the transaction before running any of this code: 
```solidity
// Check if the delegator is already bonded to the validator.
    contains bonded[r0] into r5;
    branch.eq r5 true to continue_bond_delegator;
    // {
        // Set the withdrawal address.
        // Note: This operation is only necessary on the first time for a staker entry, in order to initialize the value.
        set r2 into withdraw[r0];

        // Ensure that the validator is open to new stakers. By default, `is_open` is set to `true`.
        cast true 0u8 into r6 as committee_state;
        get.or_use committee[r1] r6 into r7;
        assert.eq r7.is_open true;
lookups
        // Get the number of delegators.
        get.or_use metadata[aleo1qgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqanmpl0] 0u32 into r8;
        // Increment the number of bonded delegators by one.
        add r8 1u32 into r9;
        // Determine if the number of delegators is less than or equal to 100_000.
        lte r9 100_000u32 into r10;
        // Enforce that the number of delegators is less than or equal to 100_000.
        assert.eq r10 true;
        // Set the new number of delegators.
        set r9 into metadata[aleo1qgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqanmpl0];
    // }

    position continue_bond_delegator;

    cast r1 0u64 into r11 as bond_state;
    // Get the bond state for the caller, or default to the initial bond state.
    get.or_use bonded[r0] r11 into r12;
    // Enforce the validator matches in the bond state.
    assert.eq r12.validator r1;

    // Increment the microcredits in the bond state.
    add r12.microcredits r3 into r13;

    // Determine if the amount is at least 10 thousand credits.
    gte r13 10_000_000_000u64 into r14;
    // Enforce the amount is at least 10 thousand credits.
    assert.eq r14 true;

    // Construct the updated bond state.
    cast r1 r13 into r15 as bond_state;

## Recommendation

A general rule of thumb is that all verification checks in permission/resource guarded functions should be as close to the entry point of the function as possible to prevent abuse.

Move the following snippet from the bottom of the function to the top of finalize function, right after inputs are read in:

```solidity
function bond_public:
    ...
    ...
    ...
finalize bond_public:
    // Input the staker's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the validator's address.
    input r1 as address.public;
    // Input the withdrawal address.
    input r2 as address.public;
    // Input the amount of microcredits to bond.
    input r3 as u64.public;

+    /* Account */
+
+    // Get the balance of the caller.
+    // If the account does not exist, this finalize scope will fail.
+    get account[r0] into r16;
+    // Decrement the balance of the caller.
+    sub r16 r3 into r17;

// Retrieve the withdrawal address for the staker.
    get.or_use withdraw[r0] r2 into r4;
    // Ensure that the withdrawal address is consistent.
    assert.eq r2 r4;

    // Check if the delegator is already bonded to the validator.
    contains bonded[r0] into r5;  R 
    branch.eq r5 true to continue_bond_delegator; 
    // {
        // Set the withdrawal address.
        // Note: This operation is only necessary on the first time for a staker entry, in order to initialize the value.
        set r2 into withdraw[r0]; W 

        // Ensure that the validator is open to new stakers. By default, `is_open` is set to `true`.
        cast true 0u8 into r6 as committee_state; 
        get.or_use committee[r1] r6 into r7; R 
        assert.eq r7.is_open true; 

        // Get the number of delegators.
        get.or_use metadata[aleo1qgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqanmpl0] 0u32 into r8; R 
        // Increment the number of bonded delegators by one.
        add r8 1u32 into r9;
        // Determine if the number of delegators is less than or equal to 100_000.
        lte r9 100_000u32 into r10;
        // Enforce that the number of delegators is less than or equal to 100_000.
        assert.eq r10 true;
        // Set the new number of delegators.
        set r9 into metadata[aleo1qgqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqanmpl0]; W 
    // }

    position continue_bond_delegator;

    /* Bonded */

    // Construct the initial bond state.
    cast r1 0u64 into r11 as bond_state;
    // Get the bond state for the caller, or default to the initial bond state.
    get.or_use bonded[r0] r11 into r12; R 
    // Enforce the validator matches in the bond state.
    assert.eq r12.validator r1;

    // Increment the microcredits in the bond state.
    add r12.microcredits r3 into r13;

    // Determine if the amount is at least 10 thousand credits.
    gte r13 10_000_000_000u64 into r14;
    // Enforce the amount is at least 10 thousand credits.
    assert.eq r14 true;

    // Construct the updated bond state.
    cast r1 r13 into r15 as bond_state;

-    /* Account */
-
-    // Get the balance of the caller.
-    // If the account does not exist, this finalize scope will fail.
-    get account[r0] into r16;
-    // Decrement the balance of the caller.
-    sub r16 r3 into r17;

    /* Delegated */

    // Get current total delegated amount.
    get.or_use delegated[r1] 0u64 into r18;
    // Add new bond amount to current delegation.
    add r3 r18 into r19;

    ...
