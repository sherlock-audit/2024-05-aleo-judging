# `unbond_public` does not handle 0 credit unbonding correctly

## Summary

`unbond_public` does not have a check for 0 microcredit unbonding. This will make a wasteful execution and a 0 microcredit entry for the delegator or valdiator into the `unbonding`, preventing anyone from being able to bond to them until the 360 block window has passed and `claim_unbond_public` has been called.

## Vulnerability Detail

`unbond_public` does not have a check for 0 microcredit unbonding.

If a validator or delegator makes a call to this function on themselves with 0 microcredits it will not change the public state of the bonded credits but will make a entry into the global unbonding state for that entity with the following values:
`unbond_state = (0u64, block_height+360u32)`.

If this is done for a validator then no one will be able to delegator the the validator until the unbonding window is complete AND someone has called `claim_unbond_public`, even though the validator is not unbonding.

If this is done for a delegator or a validator during another unbond window then the timer will be reset for the previous unbond window even though no new funds are being unbonded. A validator could do this to grieve one of its delegators if it is unhappy that withdrew some delegated funds. 

## Impact

Validators will be unable to be bonded for the unbond window and until `claim_unbond_public` is called even though they are not unbonding anything. Delegtators currently withdrawaling could be grieved by validators that can reset their unbonding timer.

I have also created an [annotated pseudo code](https://gist.github.com/infosecual/d6a8442c18c987b195364fd51f359cc8) version of `unbond_public` to make it easier to read.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add logic to prevent a 0 microcredit unbond entry into the global `unbonding[]` map.
