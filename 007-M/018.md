# Fee related methods only update the fee payer's account information, and do not update the recipient's account information.

## Summary
1.Each call to `credits.aleo::split` will lose 10_000u64 of microcredits
2.`credits.aleo::fee_public` and `credits.aleo::fee_private` are missing fee recipients, causing fees to be lost
## Vulnerability Detail
###  `credits.aleo::split` 
Looking at the `credits.aleo::split` function, we can see that the function splits `input r0 as credits.record;` into two new `credits.record`. However, the deducted `10_000u64` is not credited to any account or `credits.record`, which results in the loss of `10_000u64` every time the method is called
```aleo
function split:
    // Input the record.
    input r0 as credits.record;
    // Input the amount to split.
    input r1 as u64.private;
    // Checks the given record has a sufficient amount to split.
    // This `sub` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an underflow occurs.
@>    sub r0.microcredits r1 into r2;
    // Checks the given record has a sufficient fee to remove.
    // This `sub` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an underflow occurs.
@>    sub r2 10_000u64 into r3;
    // Construct the first record.
@>    cast r0.owner r1 into r4 as credits.record;
    // Construct the second record.
@>    cast r0.owner r3 into r5 as credits.record;
    // Output the first record.
    output r4 as credits.record;
    // Output the second record.
    output r5 as credits.record;
```
### `credits.aleo::fee_public` and `credits.aleo::fee_private` 
`credits.aleo::fee_public` only updates the sender's account information, but not the recipient's information, resulting in fee loss, and does not check and record the relevant information of `deployment or execution ID`.
```aleo
// The `fee_public` function charges the specified amount from the sender's account.
function fee_public:
    // Input the amount.
    input r0 as u64.public;
    // Input the priority fee amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Input the deployment or execution ID.
    input r2 as field.public;
    // Ensure the amount is nonzero.
    assert.neq r0 0u64;
    // Ensure the deployment or execution ID is nonzero.
    assert.neq r2 0field;
    // Add the fee and priority fee amounts.
    add r0 r1 into r3;
    // Decrement the balance of the sender publicly.
    async fee_public self.signer r3 into r4;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r4 as credits.aleo/fee_public.future;

finalize fee_public:
    // Input the sender's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the total fee amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Retrieve the balance of the sender.
    // If `account[r0]` does not exist, `fee_public` is reverted.
    get account[r0] into r2;
    // Decrements `account[r0]` by `r1`.
    // If `r2 - r1` underflows, `fee_public` is reverted.
    sub r2 r1 into r3;
    // Updates the balance of the sender.
@>    set r3 into account[r0];
```

The `credits.aleo::fee_private` method only returns the `credits.record` after deducting the fee, and does not process the account information of the fee recipient (or output the corresponding `credits.record`), resulting in the loss of fees, and does not check and record the relevant information of the `deployment or execution ID`.
```aleo
// The `fee_private` function charges the specified amount from the sender's record.
function fee_private:
    // Input the sender's record.
    input r0 as credits.record;
    // Input the amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Input the priority fee amount.
    input r2 as u64.public;
    // Input the deployment or execution ID.
    input r3 as field.public;
    // Ensure the amount is nonzero.
    assert.neq r1 0u64;
    // Ensure the deployment or execution ID is nonzero.
    assert.neq r3 0field;
    // Add the fee and priority fee amounts.
    add r1 r2 into r4;
    // Checks the given record has a sufficient amount.
    // This `sub` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an underflow occurs. The destination register `r3` holds
    // the change amount for the sender.
    sub r0.microcredits r4 into r5;
    // Construct a record with the change amount for the sender.
    cast r0.owner r5 into r6 as credits.record;
    // Output the sender's change record.
@>    output r6 as credits.record;
```
## Impact
1.Each call to `credits.aleo::split` will lose 10_000u64 of microcredits
2.`credits.aleo::fee_public` and `credits.aleo::fee_private` are missing fee recipients, causing fees to be lost

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we should consider crediting this portion of `microcredits` to an address.
For example:
### `credits.aleo::split` 
```diff
+ const FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS: address = "aleo1...";
function split:
    // Input the record.
    input r0 as credits.record;
    // Input the amount to split.
    input r1 as u64.private;
    // Checks the given record has a sufficient amount to split.
    // This `sub` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an underflow occurs.
    sub r0.microcredits r1 into r2;
    // Checks the given record has a sufficient fee to remove.
    // This `sub` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an underflow occurs.
    sub r2 10_000u64 into r3;
    // Construct the first record.
    cast r0.owner r1 into r4 as credits.record;
    // Construct the second record.
    cast r0.owner r3 into r5 as credits.record;
    // update fee_receiver account
+   get.or_use account[FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS] 0u64 into r6;
+   add r6 10_000u64 into r7;
+   set r7 into account[FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS];    
    // Output the first record.
    output r4 as credits.record;
    // Output the second record.
    output r5 as credits.record;
```
### `credits.aleo::fee_public`
```diff
+ const FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS: address = "aleo1...";
finalize fee_public:
    // Input the sender's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the total fee amount.
    input r1 as u64.public;
    // Retrieve the balance of the sender.
    // If `account[r0]` does not exist, `fee_public` is reverted.
    get account[r0] into r2;
    // Decrements `account[r0]` by `r1`.
    // If `r2 - r1` underflows, `fee_public` is reverted.
    sub r2 r1 into r3;
    // Updates the balance of the sender.
    set r3 into account[r0];

    // update fee_receiver account
+   get.or_use account[FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS] 0u64 into r4;
+   add r4 r1 into r5;
+   set r5 into account[FEE_RECEIVER_ADDRESS];   
```
