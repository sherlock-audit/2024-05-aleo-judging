# A validator cannot unbond any of its delegators if its not in the committee

## Summary

A validator cannot unbond any of its delegators if its not in the committee

## Vulnerability Detail

A core functionality is that a validator can unbond a delegator even if the validator is not in the committee, as supported by the following comment:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/main/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L456-L458
```aleo
    // Note: This contains check must use `withdraw` and **not** `committee` to ensure the validator
    // can unbond delegators even when the validator is not in the committee. Of course, if the validator is
    // in the committee, then the validator must be able to unbond its delegators.
```

But to unbond a delegator, `unbond_public` must be called from the validator withdrawal address.

```aleo
// This function allows any staker to unbond their microcredits from a validator,
// callable only by using the withdrawal address of the staker or the validator.
//
// **Validators**: It will remove the validator if the self bonded balance falls below 100 credits
// or the total delegated balance falls below 10M credits.
// **Delegators**: It will remove the validator if the total delegated balance falls below 10M credits.
// It will remove the entire bond_state of the delegator if it falls below 10,000 credits.
//
// Validators are permitted to fully unbond any of their delegators. When a validator unbonds a delegator,
// the entire bonded balance is unbonded, regardless of the amount of microcredits and may end up removing the validator
// from the committee if the total delegated balance falls below 10M credits.
//
// The corresponding function for 'unbond_public' is 'claim_unbond_public'.
function unbond_public:
    // Input the staker's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the amount of microcredits to unbond.
    input r1 as u64.public;

    // Unbond the specified amount of microcredits for the specified validator.
    async unbond_public self.caller r0 r1 into r2;
    // Output the finalize future.
    output r2 as credits.aleo/unbond_public.future;

finalize unbond_public:
    // Input the caller's address.
    input r0 as address.public;
    // Input the staker's address.
    input r1 as address.public;
    // Input the amount of microcredits to unbond.
    input r2 as u64.public;

    // Set the default unbonding state.
    add block.height 360u32 into r3;
    // Construct the default unbonding state.
    cast 0u64 r3 into r4 as unbond_state;

    // Retrieve the staker's bond state.
    // Note: If the bonded state does not exist, reject the transition.
    get bonded[r1] into r5;

    /* Check Caller's Permission */

    // Get the staker's withdrawal address.
    get withdraw[r1] into r6;
    // Check if the caller's address equals the staker's withdrawal address.
    is.eq r0 r6 into r7;

    // Check if the validator's withdrawal address has been set.
    // Note: This contains check must use `withdraw` and **not** `committee` to ensure the validator
    // can unbond delegators even when the validator is not in the committee. Of course, if the validator is
    // in the committee, then the validator must be able to unbond its delegators.
    contains withdraw[r5.validator] into r8;
    // Get the validator's withdrawal address from the bond state, using the zero address as the default.
    get.or_use withdraw[r5.validator] aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc into r9;
    // Check if the validator's withdrawal address matches the caller.
    is.eq r0 r9 into r10;
    // AND the withdraw address has been set (to prevent an edge case where a validator uses the zero address as a withdrawal address).
    and r8 r10 into r11;

    // Either the caller is the staker's withdrawal address OR the validator's withdrawal address is set to the caller.
    or r7 r11 into r12;
    // Enforce the permission as `true`.
    assert.eq r12 true;

    // Check if bonded to self (validator) or to a different address (delegator).
    is.eq r5.validator r1 into r13;
    branch.eq r13 true to unbond_validator;

    /* Unbond the Delegator */
    // {
        // Retrieve or initialize the unbonding state.
        get.or_use unbonding[r1] r4 into r14;
        // Retrieve the delegated amount in microcredits for the validator.
        get delegated[r5.validator] into r15;

        // Calculate new bonded microcredits.
        // Note: If the subtraction underflows, reject the transition.
        sub r5.microcredits r2 into r16;

        // Check if the delegator will fall below 10,000 bonded credits.
        lt r16 10_000_000_000u64 into r17;

        // If the validator is forcing the delegator to unbond OR the delegator will fall below 10,000 bonded credits.
        or r11 r17 into r18;

        // Determine the amount to unbond: requested amount if >= 10,000 credits, otherwise the full bonded amount.
        ternary r18 r5.microcredits r2 into r19;
        ...
```

When the function is called from the validator withdrawal address, `r11` will be true which will make `r18` true, the code will then proceed to unbond the delegator.

However, the validator withdrawal address can only be set in `bond_validator`, and in order to do this the validator must be in the committee which requires 10M total delegated credits. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/main/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L245-L269
```aleo
    // if (new_validator)
    contains committee[r0] into r16;
    branch.eq r16 true to validator_in_committee;
    // {
        // Set the withdrawal address.
        // Note: This operation is only necessary on the first time for a validator entry, in order to initialize the value.
        set r4 into withdraw[r0];

        // Check if the initial bond amount is at least 100 credits.
        gte r2 100_000_000u64 into r17;
        // Ensure that the initial bond is at least 100 credits.
        assert.eq r17 true;

        // Get the committee size.
        get.or_use metadata[aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc] 0u32 into r18;
        // Increment the committee size by one.
        add r18 1u32 into r19;
        // Set the new committee size.
        set r19 into metadata[aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc];

        // Check if the validator exists in the unbonding state.
        contains unbonding[r0] into r20;
        // Ensure the validator currently is not unbonding.
        assert.eq r20 false;
    // }
```

As such when the validator is not in the committee, it cannot unbond any of its delegators because the validator withdrawal address is not set which will make `r11` false.

## Impact

Broken core contract functionality

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the validator to unbond their delegators from their own address if the withdrawal address is not set (which implies they are not in the committee.)
