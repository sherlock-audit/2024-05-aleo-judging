# `credits.record::join` lacks `owner` validation, which may result in merging records with different owners

## Summary
`credits.record::join` lacks `owner` validation, which may result in merging records with different owners
## Vulnerability Detail
`credits.record::join` lacks the check `credits.record.owner`, merging records with different owners may lead to data inconsistency or logic errors.
```aleo
// The `join` function combines two records into one.
function join:
    // Input the first record.
    input r0 as credits.record;
    // Input the second record.
    input r1 as credits.record;
    // Combines the amount of the first record and the second record.
    // This `add` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an overflow occurs.
@>    add r0.microcredits r1.microcredits into r2;
    // Construct a record with the combined amount.
@>    cast r0.owner r2 into r3 as credits.record;
    // Output the record.
    output r3 as credits.record;
```
As a comparison, we can refer to the relevant methods in `large_functions.aleo`, which will check whether `credits.record.owner` is equal
```aleo
function join_3:
    input r0 as credits.aleo/credits.record;
    input r1 as credits.aleo/credits.record;
    input r2 as credits.aleo/credits.record;
@>    assert.eq r0.owner r1.owner;
@>    assert.eq r1.owner r2.owner;
    call credits.aleo/join r0 r1 into r3;
    call credits.aleo/join r3 r2 into r4;
    output r4 as credits.aleo/credits.record;
```
## Impact
`credits.record::join` lacks `owner` validation, which may result in merging records with different owners

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `owner` check
```diff
function join:
    // Input the first record.
    input r0 as credits.record;
    // Input the second record.
    input r1 as credits.record;
    // Combines the amount of the first record and the second record.
    // This `add` operation is safe, and the proof will fail
    // if an overflow occurs.
+   assert.eq r0.owner r1.owner;
    add r0.microcredits r1.microcredits into r2;
    // Construct a record with the combined amount.
    cast r0.owner r2 into r3 as credits.record;
    // Output the record.
    output r3 as credits.record;
```
