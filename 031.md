# `unbond_public` logic causes issues for some delegators preventing partial withdrawals

## Summary

Delegators that share the same withdrawal address as a validator will be unable to make partial withdrawal due to a logic error in `unbond_public`. In some cases this can accidentally trigger the complete unbonding of the valdiator even when the delegator does not intend this. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a validator ever attempts to delegate to itself or for any reason a delegator shares a withdrawal address with the validator it is bonded to then the logic in `unbond_public` will prevent it from making partial withdrawals. 

Imagine the case:
1. A validator AAA is validating with 100 credits and a withdrawal address of BBB
2. A delegator CCC is bonded to validator AAA with 10M credits and also uses withdrawal address BBB
3. Delegator CCC attempts to unbond ANY amount of credits from the validator using `unbond_public`, lets say 1 microcredit.eg. delegator calls `unbond_public(stakers_addr = CCC, microcredits = 1)`

The following logic to determine if the delegators bond should be entirely removed will always incorrectly report that it should:
```solidity
// Check if the delegator will fall below 10,000 bonded credits.
lt r16 10_000_000_000u64 into r17;

// If the validator is forcing the delegator to unbond OR the delegator will fall below 10,000 bonded credits.
or r11 r17 into r18;

// Determine the amount to unbond: requested amount if >= 10,000 credits, otherwise the full bonded amount.
ternary r18 r5.microcredits r2 into r19;
```

This is due to the fact that the logic to determine if the delegator is being force unbonded by the validator will always incorrectly report that it is. This will cause both the deleagator and the validator to completely unbond and force their credits into the unbonding period (360 blocks). This will happen even if the delegator calls `unbond_public` with 0 microcredits.

## Impact

This can incorrectly force unbonding for delegators and validators.

## Code Snippet

[snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L487-L494)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/main/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L487-L494)

I have also created an [annotated pseudo code](https://gist.github.com/infosecual/d6a8442c18c987b195364fd51f359cc8) version of `unbond_public` to make it easier to read.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a a conditional to check `r7` ( this is set to true if caller == stakers withdrawal address). If this is set and a smaller amount of bond reduction is supplied than the total (as the function argument `microcredits` then consider this a delegator withdrawal and handle the arithmetic correctly. This will allow validators to still force unbond and will prevent delegators from accidentally unbonding everything without meaning to.
