# `delegated[]` state is not removed after it reaches zero, potentially leading to higher computational costs and DoS

## Summary
`delegated[]` mapping stores the amount of credits delegated to a validator. When this value reaches zero, it is not removed from storage, which can lead to higher computational costs.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a validator is removed, the `delegated[]` mapping is not removed from storage : [credits.aleo#L625-L663](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/55b2e4a02f27602a54c11f964f6f610fee6f4ab8/snarkVM/synthesizer/program/src/resources/credits.aleo#L625-L663)
```java
    position remove_validator;
    // {
        /* Committee */


        // Remove the validator from the committee.
        remove committee[r5.validator];


        /* Metadata */


        // Retrieve the current committee size.
        get metadata[aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc] into r42;
        // Decrement the committee size by one.
        sub r42 1u32 into r43;
        // Store the new committee size.
        set r43 into metadata[aleo1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq3ljyzc];


        /* Delegated */


        // Decrease the delegated total by the bonded amount.
        sub r31 r30.microcredits into r44;
        // Store the new delegated total.
        set r44 into delegated[r5.validator];


        /* Bonded */


        // Remove the bonded state.
        remove bonded[r5.validator];


        /* Unbonding */


        // Retrieve or initialize the unbonding state.
        get.or_use unbonding[r5.validator] r4 into r45;
        // Increment the unbond amount by the full bonded amount.
        // Note: If the addition overflows, reject the transition.
        add r30.microcredits r45.microcredits into r46;
        // Construct the updated unbond state.
        cast r46 r3 into r47 as unbond_state;
        // Store the new unbonding state.
        set r47 into unbonding[r5.validator];
```
This can cause problems in other areas of the code, where the entire `delegated[]` mapping is iterated over. For example, 
[committee.rs#L73-L78](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-aleo/blob/55b2e4a02f27602a54c11f964f6f610fee6f4ab8/snarkVM/synthesizer/src/vm/helpers/committee.rs#L73-L78)
```rust
  let Some(microcredits) = delegated_map.iter().find_map(|(delegated_key, delegated_value)| {
                // Retrieve the delegated address.
                let delegated_address = match delegated_key {
                    Plaintext::Literal(Literal::Address(address), _) => Some(address),
                    _ => None,
                };
                // Check if the address matches.
                match delegated_address == Some(address) {
                    // Extract the microcredits from the value.
                    true => match delegated_value {
                        Value::Plaintext(Plaintext::Literal(Literal::U64(microcredits), _)) => Some(**microcredits),
                        _ => None,
                    },
                    false => None,
                }
            }) else {
                bail!("Missing microcredits for committee member - {address}");
            };
 ```
 A malicious user can activate the delegated mapping for several addresses by repeatedly bonding and unbonding. This will make certain computations expensive and may even lead to a DoS if the computation becomes too expensive to execute.

## Recommendation
Whenever the `delegated[]` mapping becomes 0, remove it from storage
